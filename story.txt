Once upon a time, there was a dragon named Zephyrus. Zephyrus was a kind dragon, with lots of heart. One day, however, he was alone and wanted friends. So he met
Liam, and they are good friends. They exchanged fire breathing, almost like a fist-bump. Then they teamed up together to take down human enemies. The enemies
were furious, and decided that one day, they are going to kill him. But Liam playfully teased the humans, and Zephyrus laughed too. Then, the friendship continued,
and they all lived happily ever after.
